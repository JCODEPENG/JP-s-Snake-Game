# JP-s-Snake-Game
My small little Snake Game that I made to see how Unity works and to conceptualize the basics of making a game using the Unity game engine. Some further improvements I want to make in the future is to implement a loading screen that would be utilized between the main menu and the actual game scene.
Shoutouts to CodeMonkey tutorials for the design of the objects and assisting me on building the game.
